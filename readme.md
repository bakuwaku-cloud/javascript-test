# Coding Quiz Challenge

## Description
In this assignment I created a timed quiz from scratch utilizing different variables and techniques to create a seamless challenge.

The primary goal for this project was to familiarize myself with different object and variables to use in complex functions.
While the purpose of this assignment was to learn skills about coding assessments, my main goal for approaching this challenge was to learn how to manage DOM loaded events and modularizing my javascript.
This assignment has taught me the basics of how local storage works as well as how to identify uses of different variables.

## Features
- A timed quiz about basic JavaScript programming
    - Time deducts when you get wrong answers
- The ability to save your score to your local storage to compare your results
    - The high score board will automatically sort your scores from highest to lowest scores
    - Also contains the option to clear your highscores from the board

## Usage
- Visit the quiz here: https://astro0725.github.io/javascript-test/

- When you press "Start Quiz" you have 60 seconds to answer a few questions about JavaScript.
- After you complete the test via finishing all the questions and/or the timer runs out the quiz will be over 
- You will be taken to a screen with your final score and the option to submit your score to the highscore board by entering your initials and clicking "Submit"
- Finally you will be able to view your scores on the board and have the option to try again for a better score or clearing your scores.
